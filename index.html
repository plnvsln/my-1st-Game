      <h2>Rules are:</h2>
      <p>
        Using a single ball, the player must knock down as many bricks as
        possible by using the walls and/or the paddle below to hit the ball
        against the bricks and eliminate them. If the player's paddle misses the
        ball's rebound, they will lose. Don't catch the ball with a corner of a
        paddle.
